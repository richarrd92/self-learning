# Books.py

- This is a simple project to mimic crud operations on books ie data stored. 
- Something similar to a database; We will use common HTTP requests methods like get, post, put, delete etc. - Main goal is to learn the fundamentals of HTTP methods and how to use them to create, read, update and delete data
