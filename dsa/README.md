# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS BASICS

In this folder, I log my progress in mastering data structures and algorithms (DSA) with a focus on Python. The problems tackled here are mainly from Cracking the Coding Interview, NeetCode (website & YouTube), and the underrated gem of a youTube channel DestinationFAANG. This collection is part of my journey to deepen my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.
