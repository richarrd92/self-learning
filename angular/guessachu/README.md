# Angular Group Project: Guessachu

## Overview

For this project, students are tasked with developing a front-end Angular application with guessing/quiz/trivia mechanics that also interfaces with an API of their choice. Students will read through the provided [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) file and, with their teams, use it to plan the application they will create. When planning, each team will decide what API to utilize and discuss game logic, create a wireframe for their application in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and fill out [this survey](https://forms.office.com/r/mqQyHDC5Bm) for the instructional team to review. Upon gaining approval from an instructor, they will proceed to begin development on their application and following completion, will conduct an app demo for the class. 

##### Note: The instructional team will approve or request any changes to a team's project no later than the second day of the project and do our best to ensure each team is able to begin development by the end of the second day.

## Requirements Note

##### The business requirements for this project are fully detailed in the [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) file.

The specifications for this assessment are written in a way that resembles the kind of informal requirements document you may receive on a client site or the level of detail you may have after a few meetings with stakeholders/product owners. It is written from a non-technical viewpoint with no regards for the technical requirements that the project may incur.

When given large problems like this, it is easy to try to start coding immediately. This may not be the best approach to solving large problems - it can often make you waste a lot of time because you'll start solving problems before you really know what problems you need to solve. In order to get a sense for what is required technically, this project requires that you first go through the [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) file thoroughly and try to envision the end goal from a business point of view. After that, go through it again from a technical perspective and begin mapping out mentally and physically (on paper first if you like) the things you'll need to use and understand. For this project, these things may include: Missing requirements that you need to clarify, API endpoints, a skeleton/wireframe of your components created with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), routes, required business logic for the game state you design, how to play audio in the browser, and so on. Note that these things don't require you to start coding - they require you to _**research**_ and _**read documentation**_. 

UI design and styling should be your LAST priority. When designing your wireframe focus first on functionality and second on design. When implementing always focus on MVP (minimum viable product) and ensure functionality of the features before diving into the styling rabbit hole. Once you've done that and it _works_, begin thinking about improving the UI. A business/product owner/stakeholder would much rather have something that doesn't look pretty, but works, than have something that looks great but doesn't do anything.
