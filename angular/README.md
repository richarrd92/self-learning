# ANGULAR

In this folder, I cover the fundamentals of Angular, including core concepts, components, services, and best practices for building dynamic web applications. It includes several small projects to explore different aspects of Angular development. Each project is accompanied by a README.md file that provides a detailed overview of the project, its structure, and its features.
