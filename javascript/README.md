# JAVASCRIPT BASICS

In this folder, I cover the fundamentals of JavaScript, including core concepts, syntax, and best practices for writing interactive web applications.  

I intend to follow the odin project curriculum as much as possible https://www.theodinproject.com/

### Topics Covered:
- Basic JavaScript syntax and structure  
- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Functions and scope  
- Control flow: loops and conditionals  
- DOM manipulation for dynamic web pages  
- Event handling and user interactions
