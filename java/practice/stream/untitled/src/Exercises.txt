🟢 Level 1 – Warm-ups (Stream Basics)
    Print the names of all users who joined after 2021.
    Get a list of all unique email domains (e.g., "gmail.com", "yahoo.com").
    Find the total number of users with the role USER.
    Sort users by joinedAt date (most recent first).
    Return the names of users who have "travel" as an interest.

🟡 Level 2 – Intermediate (Mapping, Grouping, Reducing)
    Count how many users registered per email domain.
    Find the average loginCount for users by Role.
    Find the top 2 most common interests among all users.
    Map each User to their List<Order> (like Map<User, List<Order>>).
    For each user, calculate their total amount spent across all orders.

🟠 Level 3 – Advanced (Nested Streams, Collectors, Joins)
    Find the user name(s) who spent the most in total.
    List users who have no delivered orders.
    Find all distinct months when any order was delivered.
    Group orders by Status, and within each group sort by totalAmount descending.
    Create a Map<String, Double> where key = email domain, value = average order amount of users from that domain.

🔴 Level 4 – Trickier (Parallel, Optional, FlatMap Surprises)
    Using flatMap, get a unique list of all interests across all users.
    Print users whose interests overlap with Bob’s.
    Compute total revenue for delivered orders using a parallel stream.
    Find the user who joined earliest but has never placed an order (return Optional<User>).

    Given the orders, return a formatted string summary like:
        "Alice: $89.98 (2 orders) | Bob: $249.49 (2 orders) | ..."
        (Hint: groupingBy + summingDouble + joining)

🔵 Level 5 – Developer Reality Checks (Composability + Debugging)
    Find top 3 users by average order value (total / number of orders).
    Return a list of users sorted by: highest spending
    then most recent join date
    (chain multiple comparators)
    Simulate a “loyal customer score”: score = (loginCount * 0.2) + (totalAmountSpent / 50)

Then sort descending by score.
24. Check if any user with role MANAGER has an order with status CANCELLED.
25. Return a Map<Role, Boolean> indicating whether all users of that role have at least one order.

🧠 Bonus Challenge (the “Surprise Element” 😈)

Question 26:
Find the most sociable user — the one whose interests overlap with the most other users.
(Hint: For each user, count how many other users share at least one interest.)
