
Loops
-----
Loops are used to execute the set of statements repeatedly when the condition is true

	Types
	-----
	- while loop
	- do..while loop
	- for loop

while loop
----------
syntax
------
while (condition)
{
   st-1;
   st-2;
   ...
   st-n;
}

Note: If no {} then it considers only one statement


Ex:
	1 2 3 4 .... 9 10

	int i=1;
	while (i <= 10)
	{
	   SOP(i);
	   i++;
	}

WAP to display odd numbers from 1 to 100

	output
	------
	1 3 5 7 9 .... 99

	Refer program Odd.java


WAP to find sum of given 10 numbers

	
	5
	8
       --
	13
	 6
	--
	19
	 4
	--
	23
	 7
	--
	30
	--

	int sum = 0;
	sum = sum + n;

	Refer program SumTen.java



WAP to find biggest of given 10 numbers

	n > big
         big = n;

	Refer program BigTen.java



do..while loop
--------------
syntax
------
do
{
  st-1;
  st-2;
  ...
  st-n;
}while (condition);

Note: If no {} then it considers only one statement


In case of while loop the condition is checked before the statements where as
in case of do..while loop the condition is checked after the statements

	Ex:
		1 2 3 ... 9 10

		int i=1;
		do
		{
	 	   SOP(i);
		   i++;
		}while (i <= 10);


WAP to accept the current balance and display the following options/menu

	1.Deposit
	2.Withdraw
	3.Display Balance
	4.Exit

	The menu should display repeatedly when the condition is true

	Refer program Bank.java
