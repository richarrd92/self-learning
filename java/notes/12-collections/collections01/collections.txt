
Collections
-----------
Collections are used to collect the elements of variable size (not fixed)

Arrays vs Collections
---------------------
- In Arrays we can collect the elements of fixed size where as in Collections we can 
  collect the elements of variable size (not fixed)
- In Arrays we can collect only similar type of elements where as in Collections we
  can collect different type of elements
- In Arrays we can collect primitive type as well as reference type of elements where as
  in Collections we can collect only reference type of elements


Collections Hierarchy
---------------------
	Refer diagram collections-hierarchy.png


Collection vs Map
-----------------
Collection is used to only to collect the elements where as Map is used to collect 
the elements in the form of key-value pairs

	Ex:
		Collection => ["tiger","lion","elephant"]
		Map => {"bno"=111,"bname"="learn spring","price"=500.0}


List vs Set
-----------
- List is ordered where as Set is unordered
- List allow duplicate elements where as Set does not allow duplicate elements

Ex:
	elements : [5,8,6,4,7]
	ordered  : [5,8,6,4,7]
	unordered: [8,6,7,5,4]
	sorted   : [4,5,6,7,8],[8,7,6,5,4]

ArrayList vs LinkedList
------------------------
- In ArrayList the elements are stored in continuous memory locations where as 
  in LinkedList the elements are stored in non-continuous memory locations in the form
  of nodes (A node is divided into two parts : element value and link to the next node)
- The cost of insert and delete operations are more in ArrayList where as the cost of these
  operations are less in LinkedList
- ArrayList occupies less memory than LinkedList


HashSet
-------
HashSet is unordered and does not allow duplicate elements

LinkedHashSet
-------------
LinkedHashSet is ordered and does not allow duplicate elements

TreeSet
-------
TreeSet is sorted and does not allow duplicate elements
TreeSet is sorted based on keys and no duplicate keys

HashMap
-------
HashMap is unordered based on keys and no duplicate keys

LinkedHashMap
-------------
LinkedHashMap is ordered based on keys and no duplicate keys
