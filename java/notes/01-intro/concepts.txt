
Programming Concepts
--------------------
Program
-------
A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a task

Comments
--------
Comments are used to document a program and ignored by the programming language

	Types of comments
	-----------------
	- Single line comments => //
	- Multiline comments => /* ... */

	Ex:
		//to find area of a circle

	Ex:
		/*
			to add a product
			into the shopping cart
		*/

Keyword
-------
A keyword is a reserved word/predefined word whose meaning is known to the language directly

	Ex:
		class, if, else, switch, while, do, for, int, float, char, public, private etc


Variable
--------
A variable is an identifier which allocates some memory space to hold the data

	Ex:
		studentName
		customer_address
		employeeSalary
		itemName


Data Type
---------
Type of data the variable holds is called as data type

	- int //EX: 25, 98, 0, -86
	- char //Ex: 'a', 'p', '9', '*'
	- float //EX: 5.4, 3.14, 87,9, -75.56
	- String //Ex: "apple", "Mumbai", "1234-hyd"


Declaration of Variable
-----------------------
In order to allocate memory space for variable we need to declare the variable

syntax (Rules of a language)
------
datatype var1, var2, ..., varn;


Ex:
	int a,b;
	char c;
	float f;


Method/Function
---------------
A method is a subprogram which is used to do a specific task

Ex:

	//Defining the method
	float areaCircle(int radius)//radius is called as argument/parameter
	{
  	   float PI = 3.14;
	   float area = PI * radius * radius;
	   return area;
	}

	
	//calling the method
	float area = areaCircle(5);
	print(area);//78.5

	The return type of areaCircle() method is float


	void areaCircle(int radius)//radius is called as argument/parameter
	{
  	   float PI = 3.14;
	   float area = PI * radius * radius;
	   print(area);
	}


	void means no return type


	Ex:
		void printMessage(String msg)
		{
			print(msg);
                }

		printMessage("Hello");



	Ex:
		int calculateTotal(int mark1, int mark2, int mark3)
		{
		   int total;
		   total = mark1 + mark2 + mark3;
		   return total;
		}
