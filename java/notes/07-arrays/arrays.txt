
Arrays
------
An array is a collection of elements of similar data type and stored in continuous
memory locations


Declaration
-----------
syntax
------
datatype[] arrayname;
	or
datatype arrayname[];
	or
datatype []arrayname;

[]datatype arrayname;//error


Ex:
int[] n;
String empNames[];
double []empSalaries;


int n[5];//Error - In Java arrays are reference data type

Note
----
Memory allocation for reference data type is done during runtime using new operator

Memory Allocation
-----------------
int[] n = new int[5];

	Refer diagram Arrays.png


WAP to create an int array of given size and display the elements of the array
	Refer program ArrayCreate.java

WAP to find sum of given array elements
	Refer program ArraySum.java

Note
----
In Java if we try to access an array element which is out of index then it will throw
an exception (runtime error)


WAP to search an element from the given array
	Refer program ArraySearch.java

	

Note
----
int n[5];//error
int[] n = new int[];//error

Assignment - Arrays
-------------------
WAP to find biggest, second biggest, smallest and second smallest from the given array
	int[] n = {5,8,6,4,7};

	output
	------
	Big = 8
	Second Big = 7
	Small = 4
	Second Small = 5
