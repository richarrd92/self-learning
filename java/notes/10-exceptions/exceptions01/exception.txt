
Exception Handling
------------------
Types of Errors
---------------
- Compile time or syntax errors
- Logical or semantic errors
	Ex:
		int sum=0;
		for(int n=1;n<10;n++)
		   sum = sum + n;
		SOP(sum);//45 - expected is 55

- Runtime Errors or Exceptions


- An exception is a runtime error which occurs during program execution and terminates the program abnormally

- Exception Handling is used to avoid the abnormal termination of application and makes the program robust (strong)


Five keywords in Exception Handling
-----------------------------------
blocks
------
- try
- catch
- finally

clauses
-------
- throw
- throws


try and catch block
-------------------
syntax
------
try
{
   st-1;
   st-2;//exception
   ...
   st-n;
}
catch(Exception e)
{
  //handle the exception
}

If an exception occurs in try block, the Java runtime will throw an exception which is catch by
catch block and handles the exception and the remaining part of try block will not get executed

Checked Exceptions
------------------
Otherthan Runtime Exceptions like IOException, SQLException, user defined exceptions etc 
are checked exceptions
If a method throws an exception then this method need to be caught (try and catch) or 
declared to be thrown (throws)
