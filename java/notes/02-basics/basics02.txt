
Java Introduction
-----------------
Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language

Object Oriented Concepts
------------------------
- Objects => is a real time entity which has identity, state and behavior
- Classes => It is a collection of data members and methods
	Ex:
		class Person
		{
		    //Data members
		    int age;
		    String name;
		    float height;
	  	    //Methods
		     void eat(){...}
		     void walk(){...}
		}

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism


Platform Independent
--------------------
- Java is platform independent

Download and Install Java 23 version
------------------------------------
Google: java 23 download
url: https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/



C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-23 } JAVA_HOME

java.exe and javac.exe commands are present in JAVA_HOME\bin folder

Setting path to JAVA_HOME\bin folder at command prompt
------------------------------------------------------
C:\>set path = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-23\bin;%path%;


Developing a Java Application at command prompt
-----------------------------------------------
- Open command prompt by typing "cmd" in search/run
	C:\>

- Create a folder/directory "JavaPrograms" as follows
	C:\>md JavaPrograms

	md means make directory

- Change the folder/directory to "JavaPrograms" as follows
	C:\>cd JavaPrograms
	C:\JavaPrograms>
		cd means change directory

- Create a Java source code file "HelloWorld.java" as follows
	C:\JavaPrograms>notepad HelloWorld.java

- Type the following code in HelloWorld.java

	//to display Hello World message onto the screen
	class HelloWorld
	{
   	   public static void main(String[] args)
   	   {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
   	   }
	}

	Note: Save the file (ctrl + s)

- Compile the Java source code file, HelloWorld.java as follows
	C:\JavaPrograms>javac HelloWorld.java
		which creates HelloWorld.class, called as byte code

- Run the Java byte code file, HelloWorld.class as follows
	C:\JavaPrograms>java HelloWorld

	which displays "Hello World"  message onto the screen


Note
----
- In Java, every statement should end with a semicolon (;)
- Java is case sensitive programming language means there is a difference between upper case and lower case letters


System.out.println()
--------------------
It is used to display messages or the value of variables or both onto the screen

System is a predefined class

Ex:
	System.out.println("Welcome");

	output
	------
	Welcome

Ex:
	int age = 20;
	System.out.println(age);

	output
	------
	20


Ex:
	int netSalary = 50000;
	System.out.println("Net Salary = "+netSalary);

	output
	------
	Net Salary = 50000
