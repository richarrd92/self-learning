
Java Introduction
-----------------
- Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language developed by James Gosling
  at Sun Microsystems
- Sun Microsystems is acquired by Oracle Corp in 2010 year


Object Oriented Concepts
------------------------
- Object
- Class
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism


Object
------
An object is a real time entity which has identity, state and behavior

	Refer diagram object.png

Class
-----
A class is a collection of data members and methods

Ex:
	class Person
	{
	   //Data members
	   int age;
	   String name;
	   float height;
           //Methods
 	   void walk(){...}
           void eat(){...}
	}


{} => block/scope

	age = 25;//error


The members (data members/methods) of the class are accessed using objects with dot(.) operator


Creating objects
----------------
syntax (Rules of a language)
------
ClassName objName = new ClassName();


Ex:
	Person p = new Person();//p is an object of class Person

	p.age = 25;
	p.name = "John";
	p.height = 5.4;
	p.walk();
	p.eat();
