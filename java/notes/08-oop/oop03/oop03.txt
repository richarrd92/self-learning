
Inheritance
-----------
- The process of creating new classes from an existing classes is called as inheritance
- In Java, extends keyword is used to create a new class from an existing class

	Ex:
		class Vehicle //Base or Super or Parent class
		{
		   ...
		}
		class Car extends Vehicle //Derived or Sub or Child class
		{
		   ...
		}

- Through inheritance we can achieve reusability of the code

- Java does not support multiple inheritance due to ambiguities means in Java a class can extend
  only one class

	Ex:
		class A
		{
		   ...
		}
		class B
		{
		   ...
		}
		class C extends A, B {...}//error - does not support multiple inheritance

Ex:

Furniture (Chair, Table)
Fruit (Mango, Apple, Orange)
Vehicle (Bike, Car)
Account (SavingAccount, CurrentAccount)

- Inheritance is "is-a" relationship

has-a relationship
------------------
Ex:
	class Book
	{
	  ...
	}

	class Library extends Book {...} //not good


	class Library //Library has Book
	{
	   Book book;
	}


	Refer program InheritanceDemo1.java


Polymorphism
------------
Polymorphism means many forms

	Types
	-----
	- Compile time
		- Method overloading

	- Runtime time
		- Method overriding


Method overloading
------------------
- Method name is same but the signature is different
	signature => number of arguments/type of arguments

	Ex:
		int area(int, int, int){...}
		int area(int, int){...}
		float area(float, float){...}

- Applicable within the same class as well as subclasses


Method overriding
-----------------
- Method name is same and signature is also same
- Applicable only in subclasses

	Ex:
		class Vehicle
		{
		   void drive(){...}
		}
		class Car extends Vehicle
		{
		   void drive(int speed){...}//overloaded method
		   void drive(){...}//overridden method
		}

		Car c = new Car();
		c.drive();//invokes drive() of Car

- If a subclass object invokes the overridden method then it can invoke the method present in subclass

super reference 
---------------
It is used to invoke the Base class members from Derived class method
