
static keyword
---------------
- static keyword can be used for data members, methods and inner classes (a class within a class)
- static keyword cannot be used for top level class (outer classes)
	Ex:
		static class MyClass {} //error
- static keyword cannot be used for local variables (declared within a method)
	Ex:
		class MyClass
		{
		   void ppp()
                   {
			static int n;//error - local variable cannot be static
                   }
		}

- static members are accessible directly with the classname without creating objects
- A static method can access only other static members directly
- A static variable acts as a global variable within class means all objects of the class can access
  static variable memory

		Refer program StaticDemo.java


Packages
--------
- A package is a collection of related classes (.class files)
- package keyword is used to create a package
	Ex:
		package mypack;

- package statement should be the first statement in the source code file
	Ex:
		MyClass.java
		-------------
		package mypack;
		import ...
		import ...
		class MyClass1
		{}
		class MyClass2
		{}

- In a source code file we can have only one package statement with multiple import statements
  and multiple class definitions
- The classes under the package are stored in a folder whose name is same as the package name
- Only public classes are accessible outside the package
- To use the classes of one package into another package we need to import the package
	Ex:
		import mypack.MyClass1;
		import mypack.MyClass2;
			or
		import mypack.*;//* indicates all classes under the package


Example Application
-------------------
- create a new package "mypack1" in MyProject

	Right click on MyProject -> New -> Package

	Name : mypack1

	and click Finish

- Create a class "Calculator" in mypack1 package

	Right click on mypack1 -> New -> Class

	Name : Calculator

	and click Finish

	Refer program Calculator.java

- create a new package "mypack2" in MyProject

	Right click on MyProject -> New -> Package

	Name : mypack2

	and click Finish

- Create a class "CalculatorTest" in mypack2 package

	Right click on mypack2 -> New -> Class

	Name : CalculatorTest


	make check mark to main() 

	and click Finish

	Refer program CalculatorTest.java (Run)

	
package com.oop.programs;

	- creates a folder "com" with a subfolder "oop" under "com" folder and with a subfolder "programs"
	  under "oop" folder


import java.util.Scanner;

	Scanner is a .class file present in "util" folder which is subfolder of "java" folder
