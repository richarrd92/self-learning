# **Web Development & DSA**

Welcome! This repo documents my self-taught journey as a full-stack developer and my exploration of data structures and algorithms. While studying at UMBC, Iâ€™m gaining hands-on experience with modern web technologies and sharpening my problem-solving skills for both interviews and real-world scenarios.

## **Full-Stack Web Development**

I'm building scalable applications using tools like HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, FastAPI, MongoDB, Prisma, and more. My focus is on mastering full-stack workflows and staying up-to-date with industry best practices.

### **Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, Tailwind  
- JavaScript, TypeScript  
- React, Next.js  

### **Backend**
- Node.js, Python, FastAPI  
- Express.js, MongoDB, Prisma, NeonDB  
- SQL, Postman  

### **Full-Stack**
- API Integration  
- State Management (React Hooks)  
- Auth (Login/Signup)  
- Responsive Design  

### **Tools & Extras**
- Git, GitHub  
- Deployment (Netlify, Heroku, Vercel)  
- Clerk (Auth), Cloudinary (Media)  
- Docker (Optional), DaisyUI  
- Command Line Basics  

## **Data Structures & Algorithms**

This section features my DSA practice from basic concepts to advanced topics as I build a strong foundation for interviews and future development.

### **Topics Covered**
- Sorting (Quick, Merge, Bucket)  
- Searching (Binary, Linear)  
- Data Structures (Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs)  
- Advanced (Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Heaps)  

### **Goals**
- Improve problem-solving and efficiency  
- Master time and space complexity  
- Build a personal reference for interviews and projects
