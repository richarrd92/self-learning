# **Web Development & DSA**

Welcome! This repository tracks my journey as a self-taught full-stack developer and my deep dive into data structures and algorithms. Alongside my studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, I'm building hands-on experience with modern web development technologies and sharpening my problem-solving skills for technical interviews and real-world applications.

## **Full-Stack Web Development**

I’m learning and applying tools like HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, FastAPI, MongoDB, Prisma, and more. My goal is to build scalable full-stack applications, understand modern development workflows, and stay current with the latest best practices.

#### **Frontend Development**
- HTML  
- CSS  
- Tailwind  
- JavaScript  
- React  
- TypeScript  
- Next.js  

#### **Backend Development**
- Node.js  
- Python  
- FastAPI  
- MongoDB  
- Prisma  
- NeonDB  
- Express.js  
- Postman  
- SQL  

#### **Full-Stack Development**
- API Integration  
- State Management (React Hooks)  
- Authentication & Authorization  
- Responsive Web Design  

#### **Additional Tools & Skills**
- Basic Command-Line Skills  
- Deployment (Netlify, Heroku, Vercel)  
- Git & GitHub  
- Docker (Optional)  
- Clerk (User Authentication)  
- Cloudinary (Media Upload Services)  
- DaisyUI (Component Library)  

## **Data Structures and Algorithms**

This section contains my personal practice with various data structures and algorithms. It’s a space for me to learn, experiment, and prepare for technical interviews by building a solid foundation in algorithmic thinking.

#### **Contents**
- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bucket Sort)  
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)  
- Data Structures (e.g., Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs)  
- Advanced Topics (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, Heaps)  

#### **Purpose**
- Strengthen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking  
- Understand efficiency and time/space complexity  
- Build a go-to reference for future projects and interviews
